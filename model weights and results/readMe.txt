The individual model weights and the predicted action labels for the test samples can be found in the respective dataset folder. There are 
4 streams for each category of dataset. Hence, with the inclusion of the validation label file, there will be 9 (4*2 + 1) files in each folder except 'Ablation study' and 'Input feature study' folders.

The ensemble results for the different datasets can be found in the "Results" Jupyter Notebook.
